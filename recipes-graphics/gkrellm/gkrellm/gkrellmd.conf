# Sample config file for the GKrellM server gkrellmd

# The server update frequency is independent of and should be less than
# the client update frequency.  Values may be from 1 to 10 and should be
# smaller values to reduce network traffic.
#
update-hz 2

# Limit number of simultaneous clients allowed to connect.
#
max-clients 5

# Specify a specific network interface to listen on for connections.
# By default gkrellmd listens on all available network interfaces.
#
#address 127.0.0.1

# Specify the port to listen on for connections.
#
#port 19150

# List of hosts allowed to connect.  If no hosts are specified in a
# gkrellmd.conf file or on the command line, all hosts will be allowed.
#

# Drop privileges after startup (you must start gkrellmd as root to do it).
# NOTE: Option ignored on Windows
#
user	nobody
group	nogroup

# Create a PID file for the running gkrellmd.  Default is no PID file.
# NOTE: Option ignored on Windows
#

# Run in background and detach from the controlling terminal
# NOTE: Option ignored on Windows

# Enable writing logging message to the system syslog file
# NOTE: On windows this enables logging to the windows event log

# Time interval between checks for various monitors.  If nfs-interval
# is <= 0 then gkrellmd will not read data for nfs file system types.
#
fs-interval 4
nfs-interval 0

# The Internet monitor defaults to reading tcp connections once per second.
# However, for Linux SMP kernels where reading /proc/net/tcp causes high
# cpu usage, the inet-interval may be set to 1-20 seconds to slow down
# /proc/net/tcp reads.  Or set it to 0 to totally disable the Inet monitor.
# Requires at least gkrellmd version 2.1.8.
#
inet-interval 3

# If the mbmon daemon is started before gkrellmd with this command:
#     mbmon -r -P port-number
# (the "-r" mbmon tag mode is required) then gkrellmd will monitor mbmon
# reported sensors if this is uncommented and the port-numbers match.
#
#mbmon-port port-number

# Configure gkrellm clients to disconnect from a gkrellmd server if
# there is an io-timeout seconds interval where the client receives no input
# from the server.  Use this for conditions where gkrellmd may be
# ungracefully terminated such that socket connections are not closed.
# Minimum is 2 (less than 2 for no I/O disconnecting and is the default).
# Requires at least 2.1.8 versions of both gkrellmd and gkrellm.
#
io-timeout 10

# Configure gkrellm clients to attempt automatic reconnects to a
# gkrellmd server every reconnect-timeout seconds after a disconnected
# state is detected.  Disconnected states are created by normal gkrellmd
# shutdowns or by an expiring io-timeout.
# Minimum is 2 (less than 2 for no automatic reconnecting and is the default).
# Requires at least 2.1.8 versions of both gkrellmd and gkrellm.
#
reconnect-timeout 3

# Server side local mailbox counts can be sent to gkrellm clients.  List here
# paths to mbox, MH mail, or Maildir style mailboxes.
# Requires at least 2.1.11 versions of both gkrellmd and gkrellm.
# NOTE: Option ignored on Windows
#
#mailbox /var/mail/bill
#mailbox ~/Mail/inbox

# List of plugins to enable.  Use "gkrellmd -plist" to view a list of all
# available plugins.  Use "gkrellmd -plog" to output a log of the plugin
# install process (note: the detach option is ignored when using -plog).
#
#plugin-enable gkrelltopd
#plugin-enable gkrellmwho2d

# Configure gkrellmd to send the connect time for a network interface
# to all clients to be displayed in the client gkrellm timer button
# monitor display.  If this is done, the client gkrellm timer button can
# still execute commands on the client, but the button will not affect the
# timer display.  If you want the client timer button to execute commands
# on the server, your timer button commands can use ssh.
# So set this if your server box has a ppp or ippp connection and you
# want to monitor its connect time.
#net-timer ppp0

# For debugging purposes, gkrellmd can print out messages on console.
# There are several debug areas which can be enabled independently by 
# summing up the following values: 
#
# system              0x1
# mail                0x10
# net                 0x20
# timer               0x40
# sensors             0x80
# sensors             0x100
# (w/o libsensors)
# inet                0x800
# battery             0x8000
#
# i.e. debug-level 0x51 enables messages for timer, mail and system
#
#debug level 0x20
